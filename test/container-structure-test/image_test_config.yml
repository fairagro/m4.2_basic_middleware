# The list of repositories to be harvested. The name will be used in logging/tracing and to name the resulting file.
# The url denotes the so-called sitemap of the repository (at best it's really a sitemap).
# The sitemap specifies the parser for the sitemap url above. Currently two are available:
#   - xml (for sitemaps conforming to the xml standard defined a https://sitemaps.org)
#   - openagrar (the sitemap conists of a list of datasets from which the ID needs to be extracted and appended to
#               the base url for downloading datasets)
# metadata denotes the metadata parser. Currently two are available:
#   - embedded_jsonld (for schema.org JSON-LD metadata embedded into HTML)
#   - jsonld (for standalone schema.org JSON-LD files)
